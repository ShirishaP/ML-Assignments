Machine learning - trains or teaches the machine to perform a task. 
It automatically learns and improves the way it performs the task from experience.

For example : If you go to buy a simcard there we would have an application where we need 
to take a photograph of the person and then we also need to scan the aadhar card of the person.
The application will automatically detect the face in the aadhar card and matches it with the 
person present there. If both the faces match then the sim is registered successfully.
